# 📝 Program 57: Remove Empty List from List (Python)

This Python program removes all **empty lists** (`[]`) from a list that may contain other lists, elements, or empty lists.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Write a Python program to remove empty list elements from a list.**

---

## 💡 Understanding the Problem

Sometimes, lists can contain empty sublists. These are not useful in many cases and should be removed.  
For example:
```python
[1, 2, [], 3, [], 4] → [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

## ✅ Sample Code

```python
# Function to remove empty lists
def remove_empty_lists(data):
    return [item for item in data if item != []]

# Input: List with possible empty lists
input_list = [5, [], 3, [], 9, [1, 2], [], 0]

# Output after removing empty lists
cleaned_list = remove_empty_lists(input_list)

# Display result
print("List after removing empty lists:", cleaned_list)
```

---

## ▶️ Example Output

```bash
List after removing empty lists: [5, 3, 9, [1, 2], 0]
```

---

## 📁 Suggested Project Structure

```
remove_empty_lists/
├── remove_empty.py
└── README.md
```

---

## 💡 You Can Try

- Modify the code to remove other falsy values like `None`, `''`, `0`, etc.
- Add a **function that removes nested empty lists** too (deep clean).
- Take **user input dynamically** and convert it into a list.
