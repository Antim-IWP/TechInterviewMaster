# 📝 Program 54: Find N Largest Elements from a List (Python)

This Python program finds the **N largest elements** from a given list.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Write a Python program to find the N largest elements from a list.**

---

## 🔢 What is the Objective?

The program should take a list of numbers and find the **N largest numbers** from that list, where N is a user-defined value. The program should also handle edge cases such as lists with fewer than N elements.

---

## ✅ Sample Code

```python
# Python program to find the N largest elements from a list

import heapq

# Function to find N largest elements
def find_n_largest(numbers, n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "N must be a positive integer."
    
    if len(numbers) < n:
        return "The list has fewer than N elements."
    
    # Use heapq.nlargest() to find the N largest numbers
    return heapq.nlargest(n, numbers)

# Example list
numbers = [12, 45, 67, 89, 34, 67, 45, 98, 32]

# Get user input for N
n = int(input("Enter the value of N (number of largest elements): "))

# Calling the function and printing the result
largest_numbers = find_n_largest(numbers, n)
print(f"The {n} largest elements in the list are: {largest_numbers}")
```

---

## ▶️ Example Output

```bash
Enter the value of N (number of largest elements): 3
The 3 largest elements in the list are: [98, 89, 67]
```

## 💡 You Can Try

- Test the program with lists of **different data types**, such as lists with **floating-point numbers** or **negative integers**.
- Handle **large lists** and test the performance of the program.
- Experiment with different values of **N** and see how the program handles edge cases, such as **N greater than the length of the list**.
