# Title: LCM of Multiple Numbers
# Description: Write a Python program to find the LCM of multiple numbers.
# The program should take a list of numbers as input and return the LCM of those numbers.
# The LCM of two numbers a and b can be calculated using the formula:
# LCM(a, b) = abs(a*b) / GCD(a, b) 
# where GCD is the greatest common divisor.
# The LCM of multiple numbers can be calculated by iteratively applying the LCM function to pairs of numbers in the list.
# The program should handle edge cases such as empty lists and negative numbers.
# The program should also include error handling for invalid inputs.
# The program should be well-documented with comments explaining the logic and flow of the code.
# The program should be efficient and optimized for performance.
# The program should be written in Python 3 and should follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
# The program should be tested with various test cases to ensure its correctness and robustness.
# The program should be modular and reusable, with functions defined for each logical unit of work.
# The program should be easy to read and understand, with clear variable names and function names.
# The program should be able to handle large numbers and should not have any performance issues.
# The program should be able to handle both positive and negative numbers and should return the LCM as a positive number.    

def lcm_multiple_numbers(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    
    lcm = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        lcm = abs(lcm * num) // gcd(lcm, num)
    
    return lcm

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

numbers = int(input("Enter the number of numbers: "))
numbers = list(map(int, input("Enter the numbers separated by space: ").split()))
if len(numbers) != numbers:
    print("Error: The number of inputs does not match the specified count.")
else:
    result = lcm_multiple_numbers(numbers)
    print("The LCM of the numbers is:", result)

# Example usage
numbers = [12, 15, 20]
result = lcm_multiple_numbers(numbers)
print(result)

# Explanation:
# The program defines a function lcm_multiple_numbers that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their LCM. 
# It uses the gcd function to calculate the GCD of two numbers, which is then used to calculate the LCM.
# The program handles edge cases such as empty lists and negative numbers, and includes error handling for invalid inputs.
