# Program 115 - Triangular Number Sequence

This program calculates the number of dots in a triangular number sequence. This sequence is generated by a pattern of dots that form a triangle.

## 📐 Description

A triangular number or triangle number is the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain number. For example:
- Triangle(1) ➞ 1
- Triangle(2) ➞ 3 (1 + 2)
- Triangle(3) ➞ 6 (1 + 2 + 3)
- Triangle(4) ➞ 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)
- Triangle(5) ➞ 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)

The formula for finding the nth triangular number is:
```

n * (n + 1) / 2

```

## 🚀 Function Signature

```python
def triangle(n: int) -> int:
```

## 🧪 Examples

```python
triangle(1) ➞ 1
triangle(6) ➞ 21
triangle(215) ➞ 23220
```

## 🧠 How It Works

This function uses the mathematical formula:

```python
n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This efficiently computes the triangular number without using loops or recursion.

## 🛠️ Usage

```python
print(triangle(1))     # Output: 1
print(triangle(6))     # Output: 21
print(triangle(215))   # Output: 23220
```

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x
