# ðŸŸ© Program 101: Hamming Distance Between Two Strings

This Python program calculates the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The **Hamming distance** is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding characters of two strings are different.

ðŸ§  **Formula**: Compare each character in the same position in both strings and count how many are different.

---

## ðŸ§ª Examples

### Input:
```python
hamming_distance("abcde", "bcdef")
hamming_distance("abcde", "abcde")
hamming_distance("strong", "strung")
```

### Output

```
5
0
1
```

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- String traversal
- Character comparison
- Length checking

---

## âœ… Conditions

- Both strings must be of the same length.
- If not, an error or validation should be handled.

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Code

```python
def hamming_distance(s1, s2):
    # Check if both strings have equal length
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return "Strings must be of equal length."

    # Count the differences
    distance = sum(char1 != char2 for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2))
    return distance

# Test cases
print(hamming_distance("abcde", "bcdef"))   # Output: 5
print(hamming_distance("abcde", "abcde"))   # Output: 0
print(hamming_distance("strong", "strung")) # Output: 1
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Output Explanation

- `"abcde"` vs `"bcdef"` â†’ All characters differ â†’ Output: `5`
- `"abcde"` vs `"abcde"` â†’ All characters same â†’ Output: `0`
- `"strong"` vs `"strung"` â†’ Only 1 character differs (`o` vs `u`) â†’ Output: `1`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Note

If you pass strings of different lengths, the function will return an error message:

```python
print(hamming_distance("short", "longer"))
# Output: "Strings must be of equal length."
```

---

Let me know if you'd like a version that automatically handles different string lengths or ignores case! âœ…
