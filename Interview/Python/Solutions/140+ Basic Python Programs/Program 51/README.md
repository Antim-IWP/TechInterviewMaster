# 📝 Program 51: Find the Smallest Number in a List (Python)

This Python program finds the smallest number in a given list.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Write a Python program to find the smallest number in a list.**

---

## 🔢 What is the Objective?

The program should take a list of numbers and identify the smallest (minimum) number in the list. If the list is empty, the program should handle that scenario appropriately (e.g., by displaying a message indicating the list is empty).

---

## ✅ Sample Code

```python
# Python program to find the smallest number in a list

# Function to find the smallest number in the list
def find_smallest_number(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty
        return "List is empty"
    
    # Initialize the smallest number as the first element
    smallest = numbers[0]
    
    # Loop through the list to find the smallest number
    for num in numbers:
        if num < smallest:
            smallest = num  # Update smallest if a smaller number is found
    
    return smallest

# Example list
numbers = [12, 45, 67, 2, 89, 4]

# Calling the function and printing the result
smallest_number = find_smallest_number(numbers)
print(f"The smallest number in the list is: {smallest_number}")
```

---

## ▶️ Example Output

```bash
The smallest number in the list is: 2
```

## 💡 You Can Try

- Modify the program to handle lists of **strings** or **floating-point numbers**.
- Test the program with a list containing **negative numbers** or **duplicates**.
- You could also implement this using Python's built-in `min()` function for a more concise solution.

Happy Coding! 🚀

This Python program iterates through the list to compare each element, updating the smallest value when necessary. It also handles empty lists with a message.
