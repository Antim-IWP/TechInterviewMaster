# 📝 Program 68: Find the Sum of All Items in a Dictionary (Python)

This Python program calculates the sum of all values in a dictionary.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Write a Python program to find the sum of all items in a dictionary.**

---

## 💡 What is a Dictionary Item?

In Python, a **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value. In this case, we'll focus on finding the sum of all the **values** stored in the dictionary.

---

## ✅ Sample Code

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of all values in a dictionary
def sum_of_dict_items(input_dict):
    # Sum up the values using the sum() function
    total_sum = sum(input_dict.values())
    return total_sum

# Input dictionary from user
input_dict = {
    'a': 10,
    'b': 20,
    'c': 30,
    'd': 40,
}

# Calculate the sum of all items in the dictionary
result = sum_of_dict_items(input_dict)

# Print the result
print("The sum of all items in the dictionary is:", result)
```

---

## ▶️ Example Output

```bash
The sum of all items in the dictionary is: 100
```

---

## 🔍 Explanation

1. **Values Extraction**: The `.values()` method is used to extract all the values from the dictionary.
2. **Summing the Values**: The built-in `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of these values.
3. **Returning the Sum**: The function returns the total sum of all the values in the dictionary.

📘 This program is useful when you need to quickly sum up all the values stored in a dictionary, which can be applied in scenarios like calculating totals in financial data, inventory tracking, and more.
