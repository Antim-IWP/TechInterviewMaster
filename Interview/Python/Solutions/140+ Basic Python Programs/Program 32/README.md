# 🧮 Program 32: Python Program to Find the Sum of an Array (List)

This program demonstrates how to calculate the **sum of elements in an array (list)** using Python.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Write a Python program to find the sum of all elements in a list (array).**

---

## 🔍 What Is an Array in Python?

In Python, the closest equivalent to a traditional **array** is a **list**.

- A **list** is an ordered collection of elements.
- It can contain **any data type**, and its size is **dynamic**.
- Lists are **indexable** and **mutable**.

### ✅ Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

---

## ✍️ Approach

There are multiple ways to calculate the sum of a list:

1. Using Python’s built-in `sum()` function.
2. Using a loop (for or while).
3. Using functions for better code organization.

---

## ✅ Sample Code (Using `sum()` Function)

```python
# Python program to find the sum of all elements in a list

# Input list from user
arr = list(map(int, input("Enter elements separated by space: ").split()))

# Calculate sum using built-in function
total = sum(arr)

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of the array elements is: {total}")
```

---

## ▶️ Example Output

```bash
Enter elements separated by space: 4 7 2 9 1
The sum of the array elements is: 23
```

---

## 🌀 Optional: Using a Loop

```python
# Sum using a loop
arr = [4, 7, 2, 9, 1]
total = 0
for num in arr:
    total += num
print(f"The sum is: {total}")
```

## 💡 You Can Try

- Find the **average** of array elements.
- Use **functions** for modularity.
- Handle **floating-point numbers**.
- Use **NumPy arrays** for performance on large datasets.
