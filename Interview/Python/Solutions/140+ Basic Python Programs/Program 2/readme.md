# Python Program for Arithmetic Operations

This Python program demonstrates simple arithmetic operations such as addition and division.

## Features

- Takes two integers as input.
- Computes the sum and division of the input numbers.
- Outputs the results with formatted messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the program:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python arithmetic_operations.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter two numbers.

5. The program will display the sum and division of the entered numbers.

## Example

```bash
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
The sum of 10 and 5 is 15
The division of 10 and 5 is 2.0
```
