# 📝 Program 70: Convert Key-Values List to Flat Dictionary (Python)

This Python program demonstrates how to convert a list of key-value pairs into a flat dictionary.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Write a Python program to convert a list of key-value pairs into a flat dictionary.**

---

## 💡 What is a Flat Dictionary?

A flat dictionary is a dictionary where each key-value pair is represented as a single entry. In this case, the key-value pairs will be provided in a list, and the task is to transform this list into a dictionary.

---

## ✅ Sample Code

```python
# Function to convert list of key-value pairs into a dictionary
def list_to_dict(key_value_list):
    # Convert list of tuples to dictionary
    return dict(key_value_list)

# Input list of key-value pairs
key_value_list = [('a', 10), ('b', 20), ('c', 30), ('d', 40)]

# Convert the list to a dictionary
result_dict = list_to_dict(key_value_list)

# Print the result dictionary
print("Converted Dictionary:", result_dict)
```

---

## ▶️ Example Output

```bash
Converted Dictionary: {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40}
```

## 🔍 Explanation

1. **`list_to_dict()` Function**: This function accepts a list of key-value pairs, where each pair is a tuple, and converts it into a dictionary using the built-in `dict()` function.
2. **Conversion**: The `dict()` function takes the list of tuples and creates a dictionary, where each tuple's first element becomes a key and the second element becomes the corresponding value.
3. **Result**: The result is a flat dictionary where each tuple from the list is represented as a key-value pair in the dictionary.

📘 This program is helpful when you have key-value data in list format and need to convert it into a dictionary for easier lookup and manipulation.
