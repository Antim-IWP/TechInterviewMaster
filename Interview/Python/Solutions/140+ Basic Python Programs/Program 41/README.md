# 📝 Program 41: Remove Punctuation From a String (Python)

This Python program removes **punctuation marks** from a given string.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Write a Python program to remove punctuation from a string.**

---

## 🔢 Explanation

Punctuation marks such as `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, etc., are often used in text, but sometimes we may need to remove them from a string. This can be done using the **`string.punctuation`** constant from the `string` module, which contains a list of punctuation characters.

The `str.translate()` method can be used to remove punctuation by translating punctuation characters to `None`.

---

## ✅ Sample Code

```python
import string

# Function to remove punctuation from a string
def remove_punctuation(input_string):
    # Create a translation table to remove punctuation
    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    # Use translate method to remove punctuation
    return input_string.translate(translator)

# Example input string
text = "Hello, world! This is a test... Do you like Python?"

# Remove punctuation
clean_text = remove_punctuation(text)

# Display result
print("Original text:")
print(text)
print("\nText without punctuation:")
print(clean_text)
```

---

## ▶️ Example Output

```bash
Original text:
Hello, world! This is a test... Do you like Python?

Text without punctuation:
Hello world This is a test Do you like Python
```

## 💡 You Can Try

- **Remove digits** by modifying the `translator` to also exclude numbers.
- **Remove specific punctuation marks** by updating the `string.punctuation` list or defining your own custom punctuation characters.
