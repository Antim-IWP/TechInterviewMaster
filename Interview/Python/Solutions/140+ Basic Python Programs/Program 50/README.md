# 📝 Program 50: Multiply All Numbers in the List (Python)

This Python program multiplies all the numbers in a given list.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Write a Python program to multiply all numbers in a list.**

---

## 🔢 What is the Objective?

The program should take a list of numbers and calculate the product of all the numbers. If the list is empty, the result should be 1 (since multiplying no numbers is conventionally defined as 1).

---

## ✅ Sample Code

```python
# Python program to multiply all numbers in the list

# Function to multiply all elements in the list
def multiply_numbers_in_list(numbers):
    result = 1  # Initialize result to 1 (identity element for multiplication)
    
    for num in numbers:
        result *= num  # Multiply each number with the result
    
    return result

# Example list
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calling the function and printing the result
product = multiply_numbers_in_list(numbers)
print(f"The product of all numbers in the list is: {product}")
```

---

## ▶️ Example Output

```bash
The product of all numbers in the list is: 120
```

## 📁 Suggested Project Structure

└── README.md
```

---

## 💡 You Can Try

- Modify the program to handle **floating-point numbers** or **negative numbers** in the list.
- Add functionality to **exclude zero** from the multiplication or handle the case where the list contains zero.

Happy Coding! 🚀

This Python program multiplies all the numbers in a list and prints the result. It uses a loop to iterate over each number in the list, multiplying the numbers together.
