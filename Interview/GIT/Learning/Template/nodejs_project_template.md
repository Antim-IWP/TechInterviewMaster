# Node.js Project Template

## Project Structure

```
nodejs-project-template/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── package.json
├── index.js
├── /tests
│   └── test_index.js
```

## Key Files

- **README.md**: Explains the project purpose, installation, and usage.
- **LICENSE**: Declares the legal terms under which the code is shared (e.g., MIT, GPL).
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and versioning.
- **index.js**: The main entry point of the application where the core logic resides.
- **tests/**: Contains test scripts to ensure the application works as expected.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `node index.js`.
4. Use the `tests/` folder to write and execute test cases.

### Example Workflow

1. Define your application logic in `index.js`.
2. Add dependencies in `package.json` and install them using `npm install`.
3. Write test cases in the `tests/` folder.
4. Run tests using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.

### Bonus (Optional Enhancements)

- Add a `Dockerfile` if you want to containerize the application.
- Include a `.env` file for environment-specific configurations.
- Use GitHub Actions workflows in a `.github/` folder for CI/CD.
- Add a `Makefile` for simplified commands like `make install` or `make test`.
- Include a `docs/` folder for additional documentation or tutorials.

This template is ideal for small to medium-sized Node.js applications. It provides a clean and organized structure to kickstart your project.
