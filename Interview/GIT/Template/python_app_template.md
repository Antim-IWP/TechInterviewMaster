# Python App Template

## Project Structure
```
python-app-template/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py
├── /tests
│   └── test_main.py
```

## Key Files
- **README.md**: Explains the project purpose, installation, and usage.
- **LICENSE**: Declares the legal terms under which the code is shared (e.g., MIT, GPL).
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies required for the project.
- **main.py**: Entry point of the application where the main logic resides.
- **tests/**: Contains test scripts to ensure the application works as expected.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `python main.py`.
4. Use the `tests/` folder to write and execute test cases.

---

### Example Workflow
1. Add your Python logic in `main.py`.
2. Define dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
3. Write test cases in the `tests/` folder.
4. Run tests to validate your application.

---

### Bonus (Optional Enhancements)
- Add a `Dockerfile` if you want to containerize the application.
- Include a `Makefile` for simplified commands like `make install` or `make test`.
- Use `.env` for environment-specific configurations.
- Add GitHub Actions workflows in a `.github/` folder for CI/CD.

This template is ideal for small to medium-sized Python applications. It provides a clean and organized structure to kickstart your project.
